##Practical Infosec Portfolio —

This repo contains my hands-on projects, CTF writeups, and AI-engineered prompts used to learn and automate security tasks ethically and transparently.

##What’s here

steganography-gui/ — Simple LSB + marker-based stego tool with a "Ghost Layers" GUI. Backend is pure Python; GUI is themed. Includes usage examples.
prompts/ — Reproducible AI prompts (with versioned results) showing step-by-step prompt engineering for automation and learning.
ctf-writeups/ — Detailed writeups of labs and challenge resolutions (commands, reasoning, mitigation).
tools/ — Small scripts: scanner, parser, report generator.

##How I work
Every project includes:

Purpose & scope (ethical constraints)
Setup steps (VMs / tools used)
Commands & code
Short writeup with lessons learned and remediation suggestions
